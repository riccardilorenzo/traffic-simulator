<h1>Traffic Simulator</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This is a medium-complexity simulation for (mostly) urban traffic. It takes into account different road sizes and materials, intersections with multiple (more than 3/4) roads, differently-programmed traffic lights, and different types of sensors in each corner of each intersection.</p>
<p>From a more technical point of view, this project will simulate also different types of vehicle, as provided by the interface Vehicle (at the moment, cars, trucks, tirs, motorbikes are all planned, but can be added with extreme easiness).</p>
